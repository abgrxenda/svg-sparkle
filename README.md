#SVG Sparkle

A snippet of code that enables you to add sparkle to any element.

Simply include the files and then call `svgSparkle()` making sure to parse it a jQuery object that points to the intended element.

Note 1: This is a rough first draft at the moment

Note 2: Performance isn't great

Note 3: It wont work with any version of IE due to lack of SVG animation support

Note 4: As of 2023, this works on Edge

Note 5: example `svgSparkle($('img.logo),5,1000)` which is the jQuery for image with class logo, showing 5 sparkles for 1 second
